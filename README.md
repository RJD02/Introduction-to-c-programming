## Welcome to my repository on the NPTEL course I took in Novemver 2020
## OFFICIAL NAME: INTRODUCTION TO C(ONLINE).
This was my first NPTEL course.
In this repo I have uploaded all assignment Questions and Solution Code.

# If you are an expert, I would recommend to skip this repo, this is a begineer struggling with algorithms and data structures

So now, if you are not an expert, Please take a look at my code, for I may not be a pro, I do have some knowledge.
Since I ranked first this year in our branch(flex!) for no reason.

For now I don't know how long it's gonna last, since everybody has an exception for COVID-19.
# BUT I WILL KEEP THIS UPDATED.

# UPDATE: 05/12/2020
Today NPTEL conducted the unproctored exam, in which, the problem statement was given and we had to code it up in c.
I have uploaded the code for the questions recently, since colleges are full-time.
I still haven't figured out #SLOT_1_QUESTION_3, which I will figure out in time.

# UPDATE: 24/12/2020
So on 18/12/2020 the NPTEL finally took our exam. Mine was in Siddheshwar Women's Polytechnique College, in Bhavani Peth, Solapur, Maharashtra.
I think I aced it, since questions were moderate difficult.
I do admit there were some tricky questions, but for some reason my friends got tricked(I mean what would you expect!, they will ask us baby questions and celebrate?).
# Yup I'm unfazed!
For now only thing left is adding that #SLOT_1_QUESTION_3 and I think I will do a typical programmer move(forgetting I ever made this repo).

# But if you have a solution, do message me(I mean you cannot know me and visit my repo).
# I'm sure that if you see this, then I'm your friend.

# FEEDBACK:
Course was good, as a begineer I found various things like file management, how to handle pointers more effectively and I think assignment questions were intresting.
Also, live session they took was helpful, he talked everything(even about his house at that time, like wtf!), he encouraged to go on developing the logic and mastering problem-solving skill.
Personally though, I solved the assignment questions in an hour everytime(We got assignment questions every 11:59 pm Sunday for 8 weeks, and I was over with them till 1:00 am of monday).
Forum was good too, getting answer after a week when you had forgotten you had even asked a question and sometimes no answer at all was so motivating.
They even bragged about their forum in the sessions and I think couple of students were high when asking questions.. I did found some mentally retarded ones too!
If the course re-runs and by chance you enroll in it, then do tell me the questions, I would like to solve them with you, considering a potential friend(preferably a girl, but bros before hoes!).

# Well, gonna leave with that, enjoy the code!
If you have any problem, then you know where to find me..
# Goodluck my friend or brother or girlfriend(404! not found, YET) or kid, I don't think the last one will read this, but whatever..
